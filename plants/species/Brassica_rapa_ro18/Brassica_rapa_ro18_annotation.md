### Annotation

[... Ramil ...]
Genes were annotated using the MAKER gene annotation pipeline (Campbell et al. 2014).  Transcript evidences were generated by assembling the R-o-18 RNASeq reads from the BE1,BE2, BL1, BL2 and BL3 transcriptome libraries (NEED DESCRIPTION) using the Trinity pipeline, resulting in 117,894 transcripts. A reference protein set was generated by combining the annotated proteins of B. rapa chiifu, Brassica napus, and Brassica Oleracaea. The MAKER assemblies were curated using NCBI Genome Workbench, and from the 43216 MAKER gene models, XX gene models were submitted and ultimately published in NCBI.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are:
* 200408 Red features, covering 127 Mb (36.8% of the genome);
* 771011 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 30 Mb (8.6% of the genome);
* 235992 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 146 Mb (42.2% of the genome);
* 243643 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 43 Mb (12.5% of the genome).
