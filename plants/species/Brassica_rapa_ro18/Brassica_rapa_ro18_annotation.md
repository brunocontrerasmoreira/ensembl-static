### Annotation

Protein coding genes were annotated from the chromosome-scale assembly using the MAKER gene annotation pipeline (Campbell et al. 2014, DOI: 10.1002/0471250953.bi0411s48). Transcript evidence (117,894 transcripts) was generated by de novo assembly of RNASeq reads from 2 transcriptome libraries from seeds of one plant obtained 35 days after pollination and 3 libraries from young leaves from 3 different plants (all R-o-18) using the Trinity pipeline (DOI: 10.1038/nbt.1883). A reference protein set was generated by combining the annotated proteins of *B. rapa* Chiifu-401 (RefSeq: GCF_000309985.2), *B. napus* (Refseq: GCF_000686985.2), and *B. oleracea* (Refseq: GCF_000695525.1). The MAKER-generated gene models were further filtered using NCBI Genome Workbench (v3.5.0), resulting in 42,143 genes , as included in the published genome assembly at NCBI.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are:
* 200408 Red features, covering 127 Mb (36.8% of the genome);
* 771011 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 30 Mb (8.6% of the genome);
* 235992 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 146 Mb (42.2% of the genome);
* 243643 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 43 Mb (12.5% of the genome).
