### Annotation

Genome annotation was obtained by using a combination of ab initio gene predictions, 
homology searches to proteins and RNA-Seq data from leaf, root, and fruit tissues at various stages. 

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are:
* 2070600 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 119 Mb (9.0% of the genome);
* 717974 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 282 Mb (21.4% of the genome);
* 1173146 Repeats:Red features, covering 628 Mb (47.8% of the genome);
* 576683 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 440 Mb (33.4% of the genome).
