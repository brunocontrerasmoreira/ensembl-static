### Assembly

A total of 543 Gb of raw DNA sequence from whole genome shotgun sequencing, and a fosmid library containing 155,000 clones from a 1,000+ year-old olive tree (cv. Farga) were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and pair-end libraries. The assembly process produced a draft genome with a scaffold N50 of 443 kb, and a total length of 1.31 Gb, which represents 95 % of the estimated genome length (1.38 Gb). This assembly was improved by anchoring it to chromosomes using a genetic map and removing contaminated scaffolds. The final genome assembly (Oe9) has a N50 of 734 kb and 520.5 Mbp (39.5%) of the sequence anchored in 23 linkage groups. Gene completeness, as estimated using BUSCO, reached 94,9%.
